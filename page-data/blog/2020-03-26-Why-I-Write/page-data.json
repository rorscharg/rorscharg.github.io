That’s actually probably\nthe word I’m looking for. Ambition makes me feel like I can achieve great things, it also makes me feel like\nthere’s a lot of weight on my shoulders. The crushing weight of all the things I should\nbe doing, but I’m not doing or haven’t done yet. Ambition makes me feel like I have a lot of potential\nthat is not beng lived up to. Potential is a loaded word, as soon as you acknowledge the fact that you have\npotential, pressure sets in. You have to live up to this potential or\naccept the fact that you won’t meet them and be forever disappointed in yourself.</p>\n<p>What makes me think I have potential is simple, I have a relatively sharp brain, good health,\npretty good work habits, a good upbringing and a lot of free time. I spend a lot of time reading or working\non side projects. I absorb information. I absorb a lot of information,\nbut I don’t take the time to share it, I don’t\neither take the time to fully <em>ingest</em> the information, which means I might absorb\nit but I get no use out of it. I don’t take the time to master it.</p>\n<p>I might have the potential I think I have, but I don’t live up to it, I avoid living up to it, I get interested in many things but I don’t focus. I’ve noticed that while having quite a few interests is very fun,\nit dilludes your ability to be truly great at one of them.\nI’ve been avoiding focusing too much on anything, <em>keeping my options open</em>, but also not living up to any expectations I have of myself.\nNot deciding to focus on any one thing. Today I’ve decided to take the first\nstep, I’ve decided that my focus would be programming.</p>\n<p>On another note, I’ve also been avoiding sharing the information I absorb because I’m afraid I don’t master it\nenough to not look dumb when I talk about it. I also want to hold myself accountable for what\nI choose to learn, engage myself to master the information I absorb in order to be able to share it afterwards.</p>\n<h1>Focus</h1>\n<p>So I’ve taken the decision to focus on programming for now, or at least for a considerable amount of time, I want\nto focus on one thing at a time (this is an idea from Steve Pavlona <sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>). I figured I’ll be able to get better at things this way.</p>\n<h2>Strategy</h2>\n<!-- ## A LEVER TO MOVE THE WORLD  I LIKE THIS -->\n<h3>What is a strategy</h3>\n<p>According to Richard P. Rumelt, a strategy has three distinct but complementary parts.<br>\nThis is directly taken from the book <em>Good Strategy, Bad Strategy</em>.<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup><br>\nA strategy is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A <em>diagnosis</em> that defines or explains the nature of the challenge.\nA good diagnosis simplifies the often overwhelming complexity of reality by\nidentifying certain aspects of the situation as critical.</li>\n<li>A <em>Guiding Policy</em> for dealing with the challenge. This is an overall\napproach chosen to cope with or overcome the obstacles identified in the diagnosis.</li>\n<li>A set of <em>coherent actions</em> that are designed to carry out the guiding policy. These are steps\nthat are coordinated with one another to work together in accomplishing the guiding policy.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>The Diagnosis - What is Going On</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>I’m spreading myself thin, I won’t be able to achieve what I want to do if I lack focus</li>\n<li>I don’t have any serious outlined way of sharing what I do.</li>\n<li>I read a lot, I learn a lot, but I don’t apply or share what I learn</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Guiding Policy</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus on one thing </li>\n<li>Share my progress here to hold myself accountable</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Coherent Actions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a clear focus every week with time set aside especially for it.</li>\n<li>Write a post a week to keep myself accountable on mastering what I focused on or learned this week.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risk</h3>\n<h4>Too much of one thing</h4>\n<p>Right now my focus is programming, which is also my job, I might burn out if I spend\nall my time doing the same thing without getting rest.</p>\n<h4>Risk Mitigation</h4>\n<p>A good way to mitigate this risk is to make sure I get sufficient rest time even if I spend\ntime programming outside of work.</p>\n<h3>Reflections on the Strategy</h3>\n<p>I don’t know if the premise of the mentioned book applies well to personal growth, but my current\nmethods aren’t taking me where I want to, a change of focus is then in order.</p>\n<p><em>To move in one direction, you must forgo all others. To choose one goal is to forsake other possible goals.</em> - Mastery, George Leonard <sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup></p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2008/12/rapid-improvement/\">https://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2008/12/rapid-improvement/</a></p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11721966-good-strategy-bad-strategy\">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11721966-good-strategy-bad-strategy</a></p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-3\">\n<p><a href=\"https://sivers.org/book/Mastery\">https://sivers.org/book/Mastery</a></p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why I Write","backgroundColor":"black","tags":["life"],"date":"March 27, 2020","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/fa8630ce2491df8ebc41cbdf4bebeb41/fdc99/1969-07-16.jpg","srcSet":"/static/fa8630ce2491df8ebc41cbdf4bebeb41/32ee9/1969-07-16.jpg 500w,\n/static/fa8630ce2491df8ebc41cbdf4bebeb41/2f7e7/1969-07-16.jpg 1000w,\n/static/fa8630ce2491df8ebc41cbdf4bebeb41/fdc99/1969-07-16.jpg 1041w","sizes":"(max-width: 1041px) 100vw, 1041px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2020-03-26-Why-I-Write/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020-06-06-carpal-tunnel-syndrome-running-caffeine/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Running, Caffeine","image":{"id":"00d2b2d6-b20f-5b94-a002-b9e2ed1355a4"}}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3868140423"]}
